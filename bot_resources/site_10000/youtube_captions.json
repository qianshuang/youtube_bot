                "text": "[0.448] - [Instructor] Installing a flow sensor [3.248] to work with the Rain\nBird ESP-ME3 controller [6.070] is a straightforward process. [8.550] Before you begin, be\nsure to check the list [11.180] of compatible flow sensors\non the Rain Bird website. [15.360] For this project, you'll\nneed the following tools [18.700] PVC pipe cutter, or hacksaw, pipe wrench [22.060] or channel locks, tape measure, valve box [26.330] primary and PVC cement, pipe fittings, [30.040] and pipe thread tape. [31.837] (bright upbeat music) [33.850] The flow sensor should be installed [35.600] on the main water line [36.790] of the irrigation system. [38.560] Upstream from the irrigation valves. [40.967] This ensures it will measure\nflow whenever any valve [44.310] is turned on. [45.770] Rain Bird flow sensors are intended [47.700] to be installed below grade [49.680] in a valve box, but other\ncompatible flow sensors [52.610] may be installed above ground. [54.870] Some flow sensors require a certain length [57.810] of straight pipe both before [59.276] and after the sensor. [61.510] A general rule is 10 times\nthe pipe diameter upstream [65.046] and five times the pipe\ndiameter downstream [68.636] for a one inch flow sensor. [70.910] This means you need 10 inches [72.530] of straight pipe upstream [74.270] and five inches of\nstraight pipe downstream. [77.660] Check the flow sensors,\ninstallation instructions [79.906] to confirm any specific requirements. [82.756] (bright upbeat music) [84.960] Start by shutting off\nthe main water supply. [88.010] For underground installations [90.000] carefully expose the main water line [92.530] and then remove enough soil [93.930] to install a valve box. [95.717] Mark the pipe at the\nminimum straight lengths [98.280] before and after the sensor [100.503] cut and remove the mark\nsection of the pipe. [103.621] (bright upbeat music) [106.450] Wrap teflon tape around the union threads [109.550] and hand tighten. [111.350] Use a pipe wrench or channel locks [113.360] to tighten an additional half turn. [115.920] Set the flow sensor into position. [118.760] Note that some flow sensors [120.420] may have flow direction arrows. [122.910] Insert the rubber washer [125.020] and hand thread the unions together [126.860] on both sides of the flow sensor. [130.270] Tighten the unions in additional half turn [132.970] using a pipe wrench or channel locks. [135.910] Connect the flow sensor [137.160] to the irrigation wire using\nwaterproof wire connectors [141.060] such as the Rain Bird WC\nseries wire connectors [144.600] to protect from moisture. [146.740] Make sure to note what color wire [148.530] is used for red, positive [150.690] and black negative for wiring [153.150] to the controller later. [155.010] Over short distances\nstandard irrigation wire [157.813] can be used. [159.620] If the flow sensor is\ninstalled more than 500 feet [162.640] from the controller next [164.150] to a commercial building [165.254] or in a lightning prone area, [167.740] it is recommended to use shielded wire. [170.468] When connecting the\nwires to the controller, [173.240] be sure to connect the positive wire [175.150] from the flow sensor to\nthe positive terminal [177.241] of the controller and the negative wire [179.900] from the flow sensor to\nthe negative terminal [182.450] of the controller. [183.283] (bright upbeat music) [186.260] Turn the main water back on [188.010] and check for leaks. [189.800] Install gravel beneath [191.320] and around the flow sensor [192.590] and cover with a valve box. [196.040] Be sure to watch the video on configuring [197.808] a flow sensor for use [200.000] with the ESP-ME3 controller. [202.641] (bright upbeat music)"

[18.750] Some of the features of this controller [20.440] are a very large screen and\neasy-to-understand dial. [23.950] It makes it very simple to program [25.650] and to set exactly what\nyou're looking for. [30.750] The first thing you\nwanna do is set the clock [32.370] to the current time [35.500] and once you've selected that, press OK, [39.580] and then select the\ncurrent day of the week. [41.761] (cheerful music) [47.100] Now we're gonna set the start time [49.830] and you generally wanna set it to come on [51.560] early in the morning\nwhen it's not too windy [54.570] and it's a little bit cool. [57.770] If you wanna have a second start time, [60.700] you can tell it OK and pick a time [64.410] a little bit later to allow\nfor the water to soak in. [67.466] (cheerful music) [71.160] Next we'll set the watering duration, [72.900] how long you want it to run, [76.610] and press OK when you're done, [82.030] and then set the days of the\nweek you want it to come on. [84.030] It defaults to Monday,\nWednesday, and Friday. [86.860] Maybe in your neighborhood, [87.850] you're not allowed to water on Wednesdays. [90.100] Just press that off.

[111.730] One really nice feature of this controller [113.510] is the rain delay. [114.560] If you know that it's gonna be raining, [116.670] simply press the cancel watering button [119.930] and you can delay for up\nto 96 hours in advance. [126.300] Let's say we'll give it\ntwo days and press OK [130.690] and this tells you how much time you have.

                "text": "[5.030] - [Narrator] For over 75 years, [6.840] professionals have relied on Rain Bird [8.840] to deliver the highest\nperforming irrigation products. [12.210] Now Rain Bird is taking\ndripline to new heights. [15.490] Introducing Rain Bird\nXFCV Check Valve Dripline, [19.290] with nearly twice the hold back strength [21.160] of any other dripline, XFCV is ideal [24.150] for all your drip designs. [26.270] In the past, using\ndripline to irrigate hills, [29.250] slopes and landscapes\nwith elevation changes [31.760] has been a challenge. [33.160] Not anymore, thanks to\nRain Bird XFCV Dripline [36.493] with its integrated\nheavy duty check valve. [39.190] Competitors only give you four\nand a half feet of holdback. [42.710] Rain Bird XFCV has eight feet. [45.520] That's nearly twice the hold back strength [47.620] of any other dripline available. [49.750] - I've been in the irrigation\nbusiness for over 20 years. [52.600] The biggest challenges we face, [55.650] especially here in the Atlanta area, [57.410] are water restrictions, drought,\nelevation, and soil type. [64.180] Therefore drip can solve\nall those problems. [67.460] Especially with the new\ncheck valve dripline, [70.260] can solve even more problems [72.360] than utilizing just\nstandard drip in the past. [75.260] This project is a perfect\nexample of why this product [79.120] will work very well. [80.500] As you can see, [81.333] there's more than four\nfeet of elevation change. [84.060] I was a little skeptical if\nit would really hold back. [87.280] Competitor's product would\ncreate a lot of excess runoff [91.430] down below, creating erosion\nand drainage problems. [94.680] Also just the installation, the uniformity [98.230] that we can now install this product [99.990] on a more uniform basis. [102.670] And I've tried other check valve products [104.390] but nothing works as good as\nthe new Rain Bird product. [106.720] - [Narrator] With only four\nand a half feet of hold back, [109.160] other driplines can\nwater unevenly on slopes, [112.260] water leaks out of the emitters [113.780] at the lowest point of the zone, [115.500] flooding the landscape and wasting water. [118.120] The only way around\nthis problem in the past [120.480] was to install additional\ninline check valves [123.210] or create extra zones. [124.900] This took more time to\ndesign, cost more to install [128.050] and added complexity. [129.780] Not with Rain Bird XFCV Dripline. [132.760] Now you can use a single zone [134.420] to cover eight feet of elevation change, [136.910] eliminating the need for extra zones [139.120] and inline check valves. [140.670] This reduces installation costs, [143.010] system complexity and uncertainty. [146.350] Let's take a look inside [147.890] Rain Bird's proprietary\nheavy duty check valve. [151.020] When the zone turns on [152.290] and water pressure\nreaches the correct level, [154.810] the check valve opens\nand allows water to flow. [157.870] Rain Bird's revolutionary [159.300] pressure compensating emitter\ndesign ensures consistent [162.790] and uniform watering\nthroughout the entire zone. [165.800] When the zone turns off, water\npressure in the line drops. [169.480] At 3.5 PSI, which gives you\neight feet of hold back, [173.260] the check valve springs back into place, [175.570] sealing off the emitter [177.110] and leaving the dripline fully charged [179.150] for the next watering cycle. [181.110] Other dripline check valves\noperate at only two PSI [184.340] which keeps them from working effectively [186.250] on elevations over four and a half feet. [188.690] Thanks to Rain Bird's new XFCV Dripline, [191.640] irrigating landscapes\nwith elevation changes [194.150] is no longer a problem. [195.750] With eight feet of holdback strength [197.350] from Rain Bird's heavy duty check valve, [199.550] you can be confident [200.700] that your designs will irrigate\nevenly year after year. [204.760] XFCV joins Rain Bird's complete line [207.550] of water efficient dripline products, [209.530] giving you a state-of-the-art solution [211.360] for every drip application. [213.340] For on surface installations, [215.260] use Rain Bird XFD pressure\ncompensating dripline, [218.980] the most flexible drip\nline in the industry. [221.450] For subsurface irrigation, [223.310] choose Rain Bird's award-winning\nXFS Subsurface Dripline [227.090] with copper shield technology. [229.300] It's patented design protects\nemitters from root intrusion [232.490] without the use of harsh chemicals. [234.810] Rain Bird XFCV Dripline\nwith heavy duty check valve. [239.050] One more example of Rain Bird's commitment [241.880] to the intelligent use of water."

                "text": "[0.003] (soft music) [5.740] - [Instructor] Have you ever wondered [7.219] how irrigation control valves work? [9.170] First, let's take a look at\nthe various parts of a valve. [13.200] Here's a reverse flow irrigation valve [15.320] that is in the closed position. [17.420] The basic elements are, [19.140] the body, including the inlet, [22.350] the outlet, and the valve seat. [26.200] The bonnet and bonnet chamber, [29.920] diaphragm, pilot flow filter, [34.010] solenoid, and the solenoid dump port. [37.808] (soft music) [41.790] Water naturally flows into\nthe inlet side of the valve, [45.240] which is most often located on the side [47.690] opposite the solenoid. [49.430] Water fills the bonnet\nchamber above the diaphragm, [52.580] via the pilot flow filter. [54.880] And the force of this water\npressing down on the diaphragm [58.420] holds the diaphragm in place. [60.560] Notice that the larger\nsurface area of water [63.010] on the top side of the diaphragm [64.950] has more force pressing\ndown to close the valve, [68.070] versus the force on the\nbottom of the diaphragm, [70.450] pushing up to open the valve. [72.840] There is also a path for\nwater to fill the solenoid. [76.770] The flow of water is stopped [78.070] from flowing out the solenoid dump port [80.490] by the solenoid plunger seal, [83.000] which is attached to the bottom\nend of the solenoid plunger. [86.560] When the irrigation\ncontroller sends electricity [89.010] to the valve solenoid, [90.600] the solenoid coil\nbecomes an electromagnet, [93.760] pulling the plunger up into the solenoid, [96.350] which allows the water in the\nsolenoid and bonnet chamber [99.620] to flow into the outlet of the valve. [102.120] This lower pressure above the diaphragm [104.610] allows the high inlet water pressure [106.710] to push the diaphragm up, [108.760] which allows water to\nflow through the valve. [111.600] Once the flow of electricity\nto the solenoid stops, [114.710] the plunger drops inside the solenoid, [117.440] and the water stops flowing\nin the solenoid dump port. [121.100] Eventually, the bonnet\nchamber water pressure [123.460] becomes high enough to\noffset the water pressure [126.220] below the diaphragm, [127.910] and the valve closes.

                "text": "[0.000] Rain Bird's RWS series root watering systems   [3.060] are the superior choice for \nirrigating trees and shrubs. [6.240] The RWS allows water, air and nutrients \nto reach root systems directly,   [11.730] taking compacted soil out of the equation. [14.670] This means three important benefits that \nyou need to consider for your next project.  [20.160] First, the RWS protects the investment made \nin trees and shrubs. Deep and broad roots   [26.430] yield transplantation survivability, stability \nand high winds and fast and healthy growth. [32.640] Second, the RWS saves water because it \nuses subsurface low emitting bubblers   [38.520] that minimize evaporation, runoff and erosion. [41.640] And third, it installs it grade and \nprotects your hardscapes from root damage. [47.070] Available in three sizes, this full-featured line \nhas a solution for all your root watering needs.  [54.430] Right away, you notice the 14,000 \nopenings in the perforated RWS tube.  [59.440] These help deliver water oxygen and \nnutrients directly to the root system.  [64.570] The RWs and RWs Mini feature a locking grate that \nprotects your irrigation hardware from vandalism. [71.350] For fast and easy connection to lateral lines,   [74.800] most RWS models come with a \nfactory installed swing pipe.  [78.790] The factory pre-configured mini and supplemental \nmodels come with a spiral barb elbow. [84.400] For flexibility, most models come \npre-configured with bubblers and check valves. [89.770] The RWS and RWSM are compatible with \nlow volume drip line and emitters. [96.160] For sandy and silty soil conditions, \nour optional sand sock for the RW s   [102.430] and RW s mini helps to prevent clogging \neven in the harshest sand environments. [107.440] There's also a version for non potable water. [111.500] Let's take a closer look at how the \nRWS systems work. Once turned on,   [116.900] water fills the lateral pipe,  [118.700] the full-circle bubbler disperses the \nwater filling the root watering system [124.010] thousands of openings deliver water directly where \nthe tree needs it deep within its root system. [129.830] Once the watering cycle is complete, \nan optional pre-installed check valve   [135.380] protects the system against backflow.\nBy distributing water horizontally to the   [140.720] trees root network, the RWS promotes deep robust \nroot growth resulting in healthy, beautiful trees [147.710] and because the roots grow downward, they're \nprotected from lawn maintenance equipment. [152.720] When installing the RWS, you may choose \nto install it on a separate zone because   [158.540] it has different water requirements than \nother irrigation components such as sprays.  [162.470] Also if you're only using the RWS to help \nestablish a young or transplanted tree,   [168.140] you may want to turn the RWS \noff completely in the future. [171.680] For trees and shrubs on drip lines, the RWS has \na special clip to connect quarter-inch drip line [178.220] To help reinforce the RWS \nagainst the squeeze of roots,   [182.270] you can fill the canisters with pea gravel. \nThis also encourages even water distribution. [187.490] Not only does the RWS distribute water to the root \nnetwork, it provides excellent aeration as well.  [194.600] The roots have constant access to fresh air and \noxygen. Available in three sizes (standard mini   [201.890] and supplemental) Rain Bird root watering series \noffers solutions for all your root watering needs. [207.740] The standard 36 inch RWS \nmodel is best for larger trees  [212.570] The smaller RWS mini with its \n18 inch tube is designed for   [217.460] large shrub and smaller tree applications. [220.040] For shrubs and row plantings,   [222.800] the 10 inch RW s supplemental model is \nthe optimum choice for root watering. [228.580] When installing the RWS or RWS Mini, make sure the \nunits are evenly spaced around the root system.  [235.450] For existing trees or mature tree transplants,   [238.540] position the units near or just inside \nthe outer edge of the tree canopy. [242.500] To determine how many units you'll \nneed, take into consideration the   [247.210] size of the tree or large shrub, the \nsoil and its watering requirements. [251.200] Rainbird recommends a minimum of two to \nthree units for each tree or large shrub. [256.960] When transplanting trees, the hole \nshould be larger than the root ball  [261.520] large enough to accommodate \ntwo to three RWS units. [265.270] The hole edges and the adjacent soil should \nbe loosened to help the roots expand the RWS   [272.320] unit should be placed outside the root ball \nin order to create a target for the roots.  [276.760] During the trees initial years, \nabove ground watering could   [281.230] supplement the RWS underground watering.\nAs the tree matures, above ground watering   [286.990] could be moved further from the trunk \naway from the root ball like a donut. [290.920] Depending on the environment and climate,   [293.350] once trees are mature root watering \nand rain may be all that is required. [298.150] In fact in some climates, rain may be \nall that is needed. Position the units   [303.460] vertically with their top at ground level\nThe RWS requires a hole depth of 36 inches   [309.280] and for the RWS mini, you'll \nneed a hole 18 inches in depth. [313.720] Rainbird RWS supplemental unit is \ndesigned for shrub root watering. [318.190] As with the larger models, RWS should be \nevenly spaced around the shrubs root system.  [324.010] Rainbird recommends using \none to two units per shrub.  [327.850] Some installations can require more than \n2r w s units depending on your shrub size,   [333.640] type, and watering requirements.\nWhen using the RW s supplemental   [339.130] in a row application it's best to \nevenly spaced the units as shown. [343.360] RWS systems are preassembled and ready \nto install, providing an immediate and   [348.940] complete solution for landscape architects, \nspecifiers, distributors, and contractors. [354.730] Rain Bird RWS series root watering \nsystems can be an ideal complement   [359.620] to any existing drip system with its \nintegrated quarter-inch drip line clip. [364.210] When you combine efficient RWS \nseries root watering systems with   [368.890] other award-winning Rain Bird irrigation products,   [371.380] landscape professionals and clients \nget the beautiful landscape you desire. [376.300] Trees, shrubs and hardscapes are expensive.\nDon't risk losing them.  [381.400] Protect your investment with Rain Bird's RWS.  [385.090] The best way to promote tree and shrub health, \nsave water and prevent damage to hardscapes."

[60.460] Insert the pipes and make\nsure the valve is level. [64.260] Let the glue dry for at least 30 minutes [66.420] before turning the main\nwater supply back on. [69.600] Next, connect the solenoid\nto your sprinkler timer. [72.772] Use watertight wire nuts [74.850] to protect the connections from water. [77.360] Connect the white wire on all solenoids [79.580] to the common wire, which\nis also usually white. [83.160] Then, connect the other\nsolenoid wire to the power wire, [86.380] which is usually colored. [88.410] Each solenoid should be connected\nto a different color wire. [92.040] Your Rain Bird Anti-Siphon\nvalve is now ready to use. [96.456] (Upbeat music)"
